# Batchflow course
This repo contains study materials for course on machine and deep learning using [batchflow](https://github.com/analysiscenter/batchflow) framework.

1. [Presentations](presentations) folder contains pdfs with slides for presentations.
2. [Tutorials](tutorials) folder contains interactive ml and dl demos (find even more [here](https://github.com/analysiscenter/batchflow/tree/master/examples)!).
3. [Demo](demo) folder contains demos from real business cases.

Batchflow itself is embedded into repo as a git submodule.

Note, that all materials here are not self-sufficient and mean to act as auxiliary tool when teaching data science concepts.

### See also recommended materials for self-study:

1. [Introduction to statistical learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL): main ML concepts with minimal mathematical explanations. Focused on classical models (linear models, kNN, trees, forests and so on). Great choice for a first book. 
2. [Deep learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org): excellent first part includes math basics of ML. The rest of the book is a strong explanation of neural networks.
3. Глубокое обучение: погружение в мир нейронных сетей.

We also can advice you a great Stanford University course [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), containing both detailed lecture slides and repo with assignments.
